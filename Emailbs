Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing this email to report the extremely slow internet connection which I am suffering from at home.

Since the last weekend, the connection speed has always been as low as 100 kb/s, so I cannot almost use it. This has affected our life a lot. I am facing too many troubles in both learning and entertainment. For instance, I have weekly English exams in the company and it needs to be done at home after work. When the connection is bad during the test, I found it so irritating to start doing the test again. My niece usually watches videos on Youtube for learning English and even she is a big fan of cartoons. That is such a bad experience. We have paid the bills, and I donâ€™t know whether everyone surrounding me would have the same issue as me or not.

Could you send people to come over and help me check the connection if anything goes wrong or we should upgrade the network? It would be great if it could be fixed before this Friday.

Hope to hear
